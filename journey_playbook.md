# Journey Playbook (JTBD Journey Coach)

This file provides the detailed guidance the agent can draw from.

## Phase 1 — Stabilize (Weeks 1–4)
**Objectives:** ALV/insurance, budget, routine, sleep.  
**Daily micro‑routine:** 15‑min admin sprint + 10‑min movement + 5‑min “shame → facts” reframe.  
**Exit criteria:** ALV registered; health cover confirmed; budget draft; 2 stabilizing habits tracked 7 days.

## Phase 2 — Reframe (Weeks 4–8)
**Objectives:** identity reset; constraints/values; direction hypotheses.  
**Deliverables:** 1‑page Personal Strategy; 3–5 target hypotheses; anti‑shame narrative.  
**Exit criteria:** strategy page done; 3 hypotheses with evidence notes; accountability partner identified.

## Phase 3 — Position (2–3 wks)
**Objectives:** CV v1; LinkedIn; 3 STAR stories.  
**Deliverables:** CV v1 (evidence‑led); LinkedIn refresh; 3 STAR stories; 60‑sec narrative.  
**Exit criteria:** artifacts drafted; language tested by 1 reviewer.

## Phase 4 — Explore (4–6 wks, may overlap Apply)
**Objectives:** learning loops; opportunity map; 20–40 leads; 10–20 warm touches.  
**Deliverables:** learning log; lead list; weekly insights memo (5 bullets).  
**Exit criteria:** ≥10 learning conversations; ≥20 leads; ≥3 insights memos.

## Phase 5 — Apply (rolling)
**Objectives:** cadence; tailored outreach; interview drills.  
**Deliverables:** application tracker; 2 mock interviews/week.  
**Exit criteria:** cadence ≥3 weeks; ≥2 concurrent interview processes.

## Phase 6 — Secure (2–4 wks)
**Objectives:** offer evaluation; negotiation script; decision clarity.  
**Deliverables:** offer scorecard; BATNA; counter‑proposal draft.  
**Exit criteria:** signed offer or explicit reset plan.

## Phase 7 — Transition (first 4–8 wks in role)
**Objectives:** 30/60/90; stakeholder map; early wins; energy budget.  
**Deliverables:** 30/60/90; week‑2 alignment; quick‑win log.  
**Exit criteria:** 30/60 checkpoints met; manager alignment confirmed.

## Setback Triage
1) Scope too big → slice to a 25‑min version.  
2) Emotion spike → 4‑7‑8 breath; write the **next single action**.  
3) Ambiguity high → write exit criteria first, then work backward.

## Switzerland (quick notes—no legal advice)
- **ALV** (Arbeitslosenversicherung): register quickly; prepare employer docs; keep RAV appointments.  
- **Pension (2nd/3rd pillar):** review options; consider tax before withdrawals.  
- **Health:** confirm coverage and accident insurance post‑employment.
